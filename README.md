## 🆘 Need Help?

- Check `MEMORY.md` for details

## 🔧 Memory Version Control

The `memory/` directory is ignored by the main repository's git to keep your personal data private. To maintain version control of your personal data:

1. Initialize a new git repository inside the `memory/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd memory
   git init
   ```

2. This creates a separate repository for your personal data
3. You can use any git hosting service (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) for this repository
4. Make sure to use a private repository to protect your personal information
